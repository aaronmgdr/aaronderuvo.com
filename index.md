Welcome.

I'm a full-stack developer with over a decade of experience building interfaces between machines, developers, and users. I believe in being decisive and adaptive, and focusing on progress over perfection. I've built web and mobile applications for startups and blockchain projects and [contributed](https://github.com/wevm/viem/graphs/contributors) to opensource developer tools with over [10 million downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=viem).
