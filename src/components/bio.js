    <p> Hi, I am Aaron DeRuvo.</p>
    <p>
      I work with product owners and designers to create interfaces for web and mobile apps that feel amazing to use.
      Fluent in JavaScript (and Typescript), I've <a href="https://github.com/aaronmgdr">coded</a> React based front-ends for startups like <a href="https://celo.org">Celo</a> and <a href="https://youearnedit.com">YouEarnedit</a>.
      I practice and believe in progress over perfection, listening with great attention, and diving into disconmfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally I will <a href="https://medium.com/@aaronmgdr">write about software, work, relationship and other topics.</a></p>
    <p>
      Currently I live in San Francisco, California.
